# Cell_Nuclei_Identification_G52IIP
This project is about identify the cell nuclei from a set of confocal microscope images.

The implentation tool is MATLAB.

I have applied different image processing approaches in the program, 
where GUI is designed to allow user interaction and make comparisons 
between different processing methods.
